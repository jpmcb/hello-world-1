# hello-world

Hello, I am currently a full time software developer at Delphix, the mayor of slack town, and also a computer science student, 
currently finishing my last couple classes through Oregon State's e-campus. I live in the SF Bay Area
with my wife, two kids, and my dog Juneau. This repository is part of an "intro to git" assignment for 
CS464 - Open Source Software.
